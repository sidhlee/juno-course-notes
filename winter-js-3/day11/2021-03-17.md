## Event Delegation

Anytime you need to bind event handler to list items that gets dynamically rendered, bind handler to the parent element (e.g. `<ul`>), then use `event.target` to access the element that the event is originated from.

You can use jQuery's `on` method to pass in target element query as 2nd argument.

```js
// on(event, selector, callback)
$('ul').on('click', 'li', function () {
  $(this).toggleClass('completed').find('span').toggleClass(['todo', 'done']);
});
```

## Gotcha: Using `e.target` on event delegation

`event.target` points at the element that the click event was triggered. So you don't really have a control over which element to bind your handler (It depends on where the user clicked!)

```js
// delegate event to parent element! => now you can separate event binding from renderer!
$('ul').on('click', function (e) {
  $(e.target)
    .toggleClass('completed')
    .find('span')
    .toggleClass(['todo', 'done']);
});
```

## Asynchronous JavaScript

- Synchronous JS is all lines of code executing in order top-down.
- Async JS allows you to keep executing codes while waiting for some other operations.
