// jQuery Image Gallery

// Open the index.html in Firefox.

// We have provided a series of images, one large spotlight image and a collection of thumbnails along the side in a column.

// When a user clicks on one of the thumbnail images, the spotlight image should update to show the image the user clicked, BUT the larger version of that image.

// ðŸ”¥tip #1: we have left a clue for you somewhere in the HTML...
// ðŸ”¥tip #2: the attr() jQuery method will be important

$(function () {

  // code here

});
