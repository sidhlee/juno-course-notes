# Day 7

## Enumeration

Looping through an object

- "I want you to enumerate though this object"

## Iteration vs Enumeration

- We iterate through something in particular order.
- WHen we enumerate, we don't care about the order.

## For-In Loop

We loop through keys "in" an object.

## Object Property Order

Order is not guaranteed in enumeration.
