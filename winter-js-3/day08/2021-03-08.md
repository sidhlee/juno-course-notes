# Day 8

## Value vs Reference

### Primitives

- When we overwrite a variable with a new primitive value, JS creates a new value in the memory and the have the variable point to it.
- If the old primitive has no variable pointing at it, it will be "garbage-collected."

## "Shallow" copy

- "Making a shallow copy" means that you're copying & assigning a reference to the existing object.
- ex) _Object.assign will perform a shallow copy of the target object._  
   => Object.assign will copy a reference to the target object and return it.

## Objects

- Assigning operator (`=`) only copies the reference to the objects.
- We can update what's inside the object and the variable will still point at the same object.
- When working on an object, it's usually better to 'deep copy' the object when you don't want to affect other parts of your code that depend on the same object.
- Or you might want to directly manipulate the object when you want to update a "state" so that some parts of your code can access the updated object.

## Object Methods

### Object.assign(target, source)

Merges source into target and returns updated target.

```js
Object.assign(state, { isLoggedIn: false})

// same, but better
{
  ...state,
  isLoggedIn: false
}
```

### Object.keys(objectToEnumerate)

Returns an array with all the properties. (ðŸš¨ order is not guaranteed)

## Array & Array Methods

Use array when the order of item is important.
