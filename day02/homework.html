  <script>
    console.log('What is your favourite food?');

    // EXERCISE 1:
    // Create a variable to hold a favourite food and console.log this variable value.
    const favoriteFood = 'Ramen';
    console.log(favoriteFood);

    // console.log this sentence into the console:
    // "My favourite food is -----." using the answer from the set variable
    console.log("My favourite food is " + favoriteFood + ".");


    // EXERCISE 2:
    // Create a variable with the starting value of 0. We will use it to count cookies!
    let cookies = 0;

    // Add 1 to the current value of that variable,
    cookies++;

    // Log this sentence into the console:
    // "I baked a cookie. Now I have -- cookie."
    console.log(`I baked a cookie. Now I have ${cookies} cookie.`)

    // Subtract 1 from the current value of the variable,
    // then (once again) re-assign the new value to the same variable.
    cookies = cookies - 1;


    // Log this sentence into the console:
    // "I just ate a cookie. Now I have -- cookies left."
    console.log(`I just ate a cookie. Now I have ${cookies} cookies left.`)


    // EXERCISE 3
    // BONUS: HINT: Google how to generate a random number in JS
    // we were given a random box of cookies!
    // Create a variable that holds a random number between 1 and 100.
    // add that new number to the cookie count and log this sentence into the console "I was given a random amount of cookies, I now have -- cookies!"
    const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
    console.log(`I was given a random amount of cookies, I now have ${randomNumber} cookies!`)
