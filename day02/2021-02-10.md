## JS Data Types

1. Number

   - No integer in JS
   - Floating point precision error

   ```bash
   > 0.1 + 0.2 # 0.30000000000000004

   # workaround: make them integers before operation then divide the result back to appropriate decimal point.
   > (0.1 * 10 + 0.2 * 1 ) / 10  # 0.3
   ```

2. String
3. Boolean
4. Null
   - Explicitly assign "no value"
   - `typeof null` gives `"string"`
5. Undefined
   - Not defined.
   - "Undefined Error" - may be reaching for variables not defined yet.

## Variables

- var-y bad (P. Turk, 2021)
- const variable must be initialized with a value and cannot be reassigned
- let is used when you need to update the variable value along the way

## Operators

## Expression vs Statement

Expression

- Anything that returns a value

Statement

- Does something but does not return a value
