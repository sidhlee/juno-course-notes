    // STEP 1:
    // Assign your name, age, and a random fact about you to variables
    // Create a string that describes you:
    // "My name is ---. I am --- years old. Something you may not know about me is that -----."
    // Print the string to the console
    const name = "Sid"
    const age = 40
    const randomFact = "Strawberry milk makes me sick."
    console.log(`My name is ${name} I am ${age} years old. Something you may not know about me is that ${randomFact}.`)


    // STEP 2:
    // Tomorrow is your birthday! YAY! Use an operator to print a string to the console that says "Tomorrow I will be ---- years old"?
    // Can you think of multiple ways you could do this? What are the implications of each?
    console.log(`Tomorrow I will be ${age + 1} years old`);
    // console.log(`Tomorrow I will be ${age++} years old`) // can't because age is declared with const


    // STEP 3:
    // When a user comes to the page, ask them for their name, age, and random fact then save those to variables and print them out as well. (HINT: What is a built in window method to get user input from the browser?)
    const userName = prompt("What is your name?")
    const userAge = prompt("How old are you?")
    const userRandomFact = prompt("Input one of your random facts")

    console.log(`My name is ${userName} I am ${userAge} years old. Something you may not know about me is that ${userRandomFact}.`)
