    //1. Let's review the current state of our TV show list.
    //Log the entire array of tv shows to the console.
    tvShows.forEach(show => console.log(show));


    //2. How far behind are we in our tv watching endeavour?
    //Log the length of the array in the phrase "I still need to watch ___ TV Shows"
    console.log(`I still need to watch ${tvShows.length} TV Shows`)

    //3. Choose your most anticipated show.
    //Log the index of any show such as "The Bachelor".
    const bachelorIndex = tvShows.indexOf("The Bachelor")
    console.log(bachelorIndex)

    //4. Save that value as a variable, then use that value to log the word "The Bachelor".
    console.log(tvShows[bachelorIndex])

    //5. Let's find which show comes after The Bachelor on our list. Which show comes before? Console log your results.
    console.log(tvShow[bachelorIndex + 1])

    //6. Wait! What about The Good Place? Log the index of "The Good Place". What does this value mean?
    const goodPlaceIndex = tvShows.indexOf("The Good Place")
    console.log(goodPlaceIndex) // does not exist

    //7. I don't get HBO to watch Game of Thrones. Remove the first element in the array and log the array again.


      //8. Your friends spoil the ending of LOST and you decide to skip it. Remove the last item in the array and log the array again.

      //9. Let's make a separate list for our Netflix favourites. Remove "Stranger Things", "Daredevil", and "The Haunting of Hill House" from the tvShows array and populate them in a new array called netflixExclusives. Log this new array.

      //10. Now that we have cleaned up our original tvShows list, let's order it alphabetically and log out the array.

      //11. Change of plans - sort in REVERSE alphabetical order and log the array again!

      //12. After watching Teen Wolf you become interested in actor Jason Bateman's work. Add "Arrested Development" and  "Ozark" to the array and log the array again.

      //13. Donald Glover releases a new track and you get inspired to watch "Atlanta" immediately. Add it to the start of the array and, you guessed it, log it out.

      //14. Let's make the perfect binge watching weekend plan with the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th show in the list. Make a new array called perfectWeekend WITHOUT removing them from the shows to watch array.

      //15. Let's spice up our list. Log the perfect weekend array as a string with your favourite emoticon ⭐️ in-between each TV show.

      //16. Awesome! To help with our organization lets combine the perfectWeekend and netflixExclusives arrays into a NEW array called bingeList. Log out your final array.
