		//1. Create an object called `juno` which contains information in each of the JavaScript data types you've learned so far. (Hint: the number of courses offered, age of the school, names of instructors, the address, whether it's open, etc.)
		const juno = {
			id: "akdhiuhe",
			years: 7,
			isAwesome: true,
			courses: ["bootcamp", "javaScript", "web design"],
			student: [{
				name: "John",
				age: 55,
			}],
		}
		//2. Create an object called "student" which has the properties: `id`, `name`, `age`, `GPA`, and `highSchool`.

		const student = {
			id: "iuh236tf",
			name: "Bob",
			age: 33,
			GPA: "4.3",
			highSchool: "A.Y. Jackson Secondary School"
		}

		//2a. Add some other properties to the object (without writing them on the original object). 
		student.hobbies = ["playing guitar", "eating pizza"]

		//2b. Using *concatenation* and *bracket notation*, write an expression that logs the following sentence to the console: "The student Albert Pierrefonds (ID: 1) is 15 years old. They have a GPA of 1.4 and are from La Reine High."
		console.log("The student " + student["name"] + " (ID: " + student["id"] + ")" + " is " + student["age"] + " years old. They have a GPA of " + student["GPA"] + " and are from " + student["highSchool"] + ".")

		// 2c. Write the same sentence using *dot notation* and *template literals*, console log the same sentence.
		console.log(`The student ${student.name} (ID: ${student.id}) is ${student.age} years old. They have a GPA of ${student.GPA} and are from ${student.highSchool}.`)
