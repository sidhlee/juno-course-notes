	// Give that object equipment (array), energy (number), grades (number), and a uniform (object).



	// Create a method that takes in food (number of calories) and then updates energy.

	// Create a method that takes in new equipment that will update our equipment array.


	// Create a method that will change the uniform (since everyday you wear something different)

	// Create a method study time that takes time studied (minutes) that will update our grades and deplete our energy. For every hour that you study, your grades go up by 5% (example: if your grade is 60, and you study an hour, your grade will be 65). For every hour you study, your energy goes down by 2.

	// *Bonus* if your energy goes below 0, your grades go down (10%)
