    // 1. The following function isn't printing anything to the console. Can you spot the syntax error? Be sure to check your console for errors.

    const iLoveCoffee = () {
      console.log("Coffee is delicious.");
    }
    iLoveCoffee();


    // 2. The following function isn't printing anything to the console.  What did we forget?

    const iLovePizza = () => {
      console.log("Pizza is my favourite food!");
    }

    // 3. Write a function `singMeASong()` that logs the text "Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, but here's my number, so call me, maybe!" to the console.



    // 4. Change this `iReallyLovePizza` function to accept a single `topping` argument, then log the argument to the console.

    const iReallyLovePizza = () => {
      console.log("I love pizza!");
      console.log(`And my favourite topping is...`);
      // Log your favourite topping to the console here
    }


      // 5. Write a function called whatsForDinner that takes one parameter, `(meal)`, which alerts the name of the meal passed to it. Call your function three times with a different meal argument each time.


      // 6. Write a function `multiply(n1, n2)` that returns the value of n1 and n2 multiplied together. *Hint:* We use the `*` character to denote multiplication in JavaScript. Make sure you test to see that your function does what you expect.


      // 7. Write a function `greaterThanThree(n)` which logs "Yes" to the console if n is greater than three. *Hint:* You will need to use the `>` comparison operator and a conditional statement inside your function.
