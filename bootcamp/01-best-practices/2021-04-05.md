## Overriding general CSS class with modifier class

```css
.container {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
.container-1 {
  border-color: ...
  border-style: ...
}
.container-2 {
  border-color: ...
}
.container-3 {
  border-color: ...
}
```

## Don't put block level element inside an inline element

```html
<a><h1>Don't Do This</h1></a>

<h1><a>Proper</a></h1>
```

## Tooltip is not read by screen readers

## `<figure>` element

Q: They do have an example where they use `<figure>` without `<figcaption>`. Does this mean it will have a better accessibility?

> Usually a `<figure>` is an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc., that is referenced in the main flow of a document, but that can be moved to another part of the document or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.
> If the image is referenced in the main content then it’s appropriate to wrap it in a figure. Remember in textbooks “See figure 1” this is a figure being referenced in the content. If the image isn’t being directly referenced by the main flow content, then it doesn’t need a `<figure>` tag. It doesn’t automatically make images more semantic
