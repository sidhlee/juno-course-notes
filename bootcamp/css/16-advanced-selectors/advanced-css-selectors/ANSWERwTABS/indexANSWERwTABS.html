                            <p>Chlorophytum comosum, often called spider plant but also known as airplane plant, St. Bernard's lily, spider ivy, ribbon plant, and hen and chickens is a species of perennial flowering plant. It is native to tropical and southern Africa, but has become naturalized in other parts of the world, including western Australia. </p>
                            <p>Chlorophytum comosum is a popular houseplant. The species with all-green leaves forms only a small proportion of plants sold. </p>
                            <p>More common are two variegated cultivars:</p>

                                    C. comosum 'Vittatum' has mid-green leaves with a broad central white stripe. It is often sold in hanging baskets to display the plantlets. The long stems are white.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    C. comosum 'Variegatum' has darker green leaves with white margins.

                            <p>It is an evergreen perennial plant forming dense stands, spreading by way of its creeping rhizome, which is sometimes above ground, sometimes underground. Its stiff leaves grow vertically from a basal rosette. Mature leaves are dark green with light gray-green cross-banding and usually range from 70–90 centimetres (28–35 in) long and 5–6 centimetres (2.0–2.4  in) wide, though it can reach heights above 2 m (6 ft) in optimal conditions</p>
                            <p>It is now used predominantly as an ornamental plant, outdoors in warmer climates, and indoors as a houseplant in cooler climates. It is popular as a houseplant because it is tolerant of low light levels and irregular watering; during winter it needs only one watering every couple of months. It will rot easily if overwatered.</p>

                            <p>Philodendron is a large genus of flowering plants in the Araceae family. As of September 2015, the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepted 489 species; other sources accept different numbers. Regardless of number of species, the
                            genus is the second-largest member of the Araceae family. Taxonomically, the genus Philodendron is still poorly known, with many undescribed species. Many are grown as ornamental and indoor plants.</p>
                            <p>The name derives from the Greek words philo- or "love, affection" and dendron or "tree". They are commonly called by their generic name.</p>
