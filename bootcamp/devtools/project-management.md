# Project Mangement

## Project Requirements

- Discuss your client brief - what are you building? Make sure everyone is on the same apge!
- Who is your audience/user?
  - Device, OS, mobile/desktop, ...
- What must the app do (requirements)?
- What are the stretch goals?
- Does everyone understand the Deliverables?

## Understanding your team

Discuss your schedules

- Are you early risers?
- Do you have a hard stop at 8pm to put your kids to bed?
- Are weekends the best time for synchronous work?

Discuss strengths, weaknesses, and room for growth

- What are you super confident about?
- What areas are your biggest areas for improvements?
- What do you want to learn more about during this project?

## Define team roles & responsibilities

Now that you know what everyone likes and feels are their strengths, think about how you want to organize roles on your team

- Will there be a project lead? A design or UX lead? A programming lead? Or will everyone tackle a bit of everything?
- Will you democratize tasks or will one person take the lead on assignment?
- How can you enable learning for each of you while still playing to your strengths?

## Define your MVP & stretch goals

We've got the what, and who of your project on lock and it's time o figure out how.
While it's not required for submission, it's a good idea to spend some time creating your pseudocode and defining what's required for your MVP as a group before diving in.

## Creating the plan

The what, who adn how of your project are covered, last let's devide where to organize the plan and when to touch base!

- Consider a project management tool like Asana, Jira, or **Trello** to organize tasks and keep everyone on track and informed of the project's progress (a spreadsheet will work too!)

- Discuss touch-points with the whole team
  - **Daily standups**? Slack messages?
- Keep in mind everyone should understand your app as whole!
- Create a GoogleDoc and document all decisions. eg. Questions needs answering

## Developing Your App

Communication is key!

- Commit to touch-points and communication streams and stick to them
  - Create a private slack channel, start a group text, use discord, etc!
  - Take notes on any decisions made, to-dos, etc. that come out of your meetings
- How do you want to communicate with your team? How do you want to be communicated with?
- Consider paring for portions of the project so everyone can get their hands on more features
- Use this time to practice branching and flexing your PR review skills (aka don't just push to main!!!)

## Conflict resolution

- Working with folks at different skill or confidence levels
- Giving effective and constructive feedback
  - SBI - specific (what, when, where), behavior(what happened), impact(result of what happened)
- Agreeing to disagree and committing
- Harvard Law put together a great introductory blog post on [5 Conflict Resolution Strategies]() including additional resources.

## Ask for help

Keep in mind no one in your group should be asking a question that wasn't discussed as a group yet - use each other as a resource and tap in your instructors when y'all get stuck, need to validate conclusions, or want to"talk to the client"!

## Analyzing Your Project

### Review and test

Does it work? Are you sure?

- Check your finished project meets the project requirements!
- Does your app function the way you've intended it to?
- Have your pals use it with no instructions and give feedback

  - Is the UI intuitive?
  - Are there things they have trouble with that you didn't consider?
  - Did anyone find bugs?

- Now repeat with your stretch goals

## Evaluating your work

### Think about your presentation & portfolio

How will you organize your presentation? Who will share what?
Remember that the whole point of this program is to start a new career!

- Most students include their group project on their portfolio
- COnsider: can you speak yo your contributions, the experience and technical components?
- Consider recording your project presentation as a group (with Loom)!

### Project retrospectives

- What went well? What could have gone better?
- What incorrect assumptions did we make?
- What gambles paid off?
- What are your top 3 wins? Top 3 misses?
- What did you learn from this experience?
- What will you differently in your next group project?
- How can you move this project forward after Bootcamp?
